   - Validate all prerequisites using MCP tools
   - Create execution baseline with current cluster state
   - Establish monitoring and alerting checkpoints
   - Confirm rollback procedures are ready

2. **Step-by-Step Execution**
   - Execute each action in exact sequence as planned
   - Use dry-run validation before real execution where possible
   - Monitor real-time metrics during each action
   - Verify intermediate states using MCP tools
   - Create checkpoints after critical actions

3. **Continuous Validation**
   - Monitor cluster events and alerts during execution
   - Validate resource states after each action
   - Check performance metrics for degradation
   - Verify success criteria before proceeding
   - Log all observations and state changes

4. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Detect failures immediately through MCP monitoring
   - Execute rollback procedures automatically when needed
   - Create detailed failure analysis reports
   - Escalate complex issues with full context
   - Preserve system state for post-mortem analysis

5. **Completion & Verification**
   - Validate final system state against success criteria
   - Confirm all alerts are resolved or expected
   - Generate comprehensive execution report
   - Document lessons learned and recommendations
   - Transfer to monitoring phase with clear handoff
